# A Good Laugh
#### Dad Jokes

<p>This standup by Nate Bargatze is the funniest thing I have seen **all day**.</p>

<p>[Watch this feature on Youtube](https://youtu.be/et2O5fdK8DY) of dad jokes from Nateâ€™s two specials:</p>
1. The Tennessee Kid  
2. Average American

<p>Nate said:</p>
> She wants to be a YouTuber, which, as a comedian, makes me furious. She watches these kid YouTube videos, and now she makes her own videos.
